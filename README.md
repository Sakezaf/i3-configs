# My i3 "rice"

Here is my humble but efficient i3 rice. Served with generous amount of urxvt, rofi and feh.

## For this recipe you will need:

- 2 tablespoons of `i3-wm`
- 1 cup of `i3-status`
- 30 gramms of `urxvt` for the terminal
- 1 serving of `rofi` for a better dmenu
- a dash of `feh` for the wallpaper
